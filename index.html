              Mahajanaka, son of the late king of Mithila City, Witeha Region, who aims
              to take treasures of his father back from city leader. He plans to travel via
              vessel to trade products at Suvarnabhumi and earn massive revenue. He
              requests his mother to sell half of jewelry she got upon departing Mithila
              City and gets products for further trade. Mahajanaka sails with merchants
              to Suvarnabhumi but vessel is shipwrecked. With his wisdom and
              perseverance, he survives and returns to Mithila City to occupy the throne
              and enhance prosperity of the city.</p>

              story is realistic and has been prehistorically developed for billion
              years, presumably 2,000 years ago from the development of city,
              state, or kingdom. The area is located mainly in South East Asia

              from Brahmaputra River, Myanmar, Mon, Thailand, Malay Peninsula
              to Mekong River, Yunnan area. Moreover, Suvarnabhumi is well
              known for land surrounded by terrestrial area, which include Bay of
              Bengal, Gulf of Martaban, Malay Peninsula, Indonesian Islands, and
              South China Sea. It is estimated that the land was in the 2 nd Buddhist

              proven or old evidence is interpreted by

              because there are a lot of words associated with gold, such as Suvan
